# Bakery Serving Size portion calculator.

#Input: Hash of baked goods, that accepts two arguments
#Output: String of calculations for baked goods that counts serving sizes, returns leftover ingredients, and raises error when invalid input is entered

#Create hash that accepts a key of the type of baked good, and a value of the number of ingredients
#Set an error counter to 3, where an ArgumentError is raised if an invalid key input is entered,
#Otherwise iterate over hash to determine how many ingredients are needed, and  calculate remaining ingredients to suggest a baked good.

#Features to add
#Suggested baking items

#  Reflection

# What did you learn about making code readable by working on this challenge?
# Since I was solo for this challenge (had to makeup gps), I ended up doing pseudocode based on the code that was already written. That was something I hadn't done before, and it was helpful to break into steps in this way.

# Did you learn any new methods? What did you learn about them?
# I ended up using .include? since it fit well.

# What did you learn about accessing data in hashes?
# You can choose to access a key or value when calling a hash.

# What concepts were solidified when working through this challenge?
# Practicing "reverse" pseudocode was helpful for me!
