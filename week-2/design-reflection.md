**What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?**
1. Information gathering
2. Planning
3. Design
4. Development
5. Testing and Delivery
6. Maintenance

**What is your site's primary goal or purpose?**
To provide information

**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
Potential employers, and they will want to know about my competencies, ethics, personality. I will provide access to my projects, work history, social networks, and any other information that might be relevant to aid that process.

**What is the "primary" action of the user should take when coming to your site? What do you want them to do?**
Access information. I want them to be able to navigate seamlessly and get information that is easy to find and read.

**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**
Design is about the aesthetics of a website. UX is primarily how the user feels about a site and their experience with the design aspect.

**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?**
UX design is really about digging into the pscyhology behind a user and their experience as it relates to the design while browsing. Think about the apps and sites you might visit daily. Let's say you're comparing goods online to help you decide before you buy—how do you feel when the design to a particular site is clunky, or inefficient? (Would you want to purchase from this site, even if it had superior product compared to a competitor who in comparison had a beautiful design and marketing angle?) In my opinion, that is a scenario that UX design is vital to help answer, and is one of the many reasons it's so.

**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**
Perhaps some of the basic markdown material that has been in a few challenges, although new resources were introduced that were very helpful and in depth. So perhaps for my experience, not too much.
