        <b>-What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML in an actual site?</b>
        I have basic knowledge of HTML, and that seems to be about what was needed for this particular challenge.
        <b>-How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?</b>
        -I was navigating for this challenge, and my pair actually seemed to already have a good base knowledge without us having to research. S/he was great and and explained to me what s/he was using and why.
        <b>-How did you do at keeping to best practices? (Like no formatting in HTML)</b>
        -Well I think, we both seemed to check to make sure there were opening and closing tags, etc. which helped.
        <b>-What seems good and bad about HTML?</b>
        The language of HTML is very simplistic and easy to understand, but seems designed around language, not necessarily for images and visual representation. Clearly, having CSS introduced and the ability to style and format text is advantageous for aesthetic reasons.
        <b>What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?</b>
        Just simple things like mentioned above, make sure you close all of your tags (when applicable), and keep it neat and nested to make it as easy to read as possible.
