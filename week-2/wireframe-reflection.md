<b>What is a wireframe?</b>

Wireframes are used in between concept and construction of building a website. You can consider it a map of what your site will look like, and gives you an opportunity to build a mock-up of what it could potentially look like once live.

<b>What are the benefits of wireframing?</b>

Wireframing is useful because you get to think about your site not just from a functional perspective, but from a design and usability state, which is really helpful in building something meaningful to potential users. It also helps streamline the workflow by allowing someone to stay on track during the development phase, by not have to potentially redo work because the layout wasn't created before constructing the site.

<b>Did you enjoy wireframing your site?</b>

Very much! I completely find value in this stage, and will always include this in my process go forward.


<b>Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?</b>

I revised the blog index once, but I may revise one more time before we get to the development stage next week.

<b>What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?</b>

I was mostly curious as to the layout of other sites, and how that might look in a wireframe. I looked at sites that I really love for inspiration, like medium.com.


<b>Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which did you find tedious?</b>

I actually found this challenge quite enjoyable!
