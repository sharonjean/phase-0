I was nervous to receive feedback this week, as I realize one or so of my assignments did not show up properly on github (and so the user leaving feedback would not be able to view it as designed). In any case, I realize this is a part of the process, and felt I learned a lot by being able to see other cohorts style of leaving reflections and completing their assignments. I thought the set up we received in week-0 was very helpful in understanding how to leave specific, kind and actionalbe feedback.
