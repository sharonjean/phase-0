#Numbers, Letters and Variables Assignment

##What does puts do?

  *puts* returns nil, and prints the output to the console with a new line. It essentially shows on the screen whatever you include after puts.

##What is an integer? What is a float?

  an *integer* is a number w/0 a decimal point
  a *float* is a number with a decimal point

##What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
  ```
  When it comes to any math you might normally use a calculator for, it's best to use floats. Since integers are numbers, and only allow for whole numbers, they cannot return a precise answer, which is why we use floats.
  **integer division** 9/2 = 4
  **float division** 9/2 = 4.5
  ```

##Release 2 | Chapter 2

  **hours in a year**

  ```ruby
  puts 365 * 24
  ```

  **minutes in a decade**

  ```ruby

  ```
#Release 7: Reflect

##How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

  Ruby uses special characters so that the computer knows what function to run.
  So, as follows:
  (*) (asterisk) multiplication
  (-) subtraction
  (+) addition
  (/) division

##What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

  Strings are just groups of words together, with a pair of "" or '' wrapped around them to let Ruby know they are together. You can add strings just like math!

##What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

  A local variable is much like a storage container, and can hold integers, strings, and any other Ruby object that you can call upon later (which saves you time as to not have to rewrite code a bunch)! Hooray shortcuts.

##How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of the basics?

  Yes! I felt like it was great to run through the Chris Pine book again. I hadn't read the Well Grounded Rubyist yet, so it is also great to get some of that information seeded into my brain :)
