# Analyze the Errors

# I worked on this challenge [by myself].
# I spent [1] hours on this challenge.

# --- error -------------------------------------------------------

# "Screw you guys " + "I'm going home." = cartmans_phrase
cartmans_phrase = "Screw you guys " + "I'm going home."

# This error was analyzed in the README file.
# --- error -------------------------------------------------------

#def cartman_hates(thing)
#  while true
#    puts "What's there to hate about #{thing}?"
#end

#171

# 3. What is the type of error message?
# syntax error

# 4. What additional information does the interpreter provide about this type of error?
# unexpected end of input, expecting keyword end

# 5. Where is the error in the code?
# line 17, the end should be indented for the while loop, and then another end to

# 6. Why did the interpreter give you this error?
# The while loop would continue without ending it, which is why the error was at the end of the file, it ran through all of the code.

# --- REFLECTION -------------------------------------------------------
# Write your reflection below as a comment.

#Which error was the most difficult to read?
#Definitely the SyntaxError for the while loop! Took me a few minutes to figure out. :)

#How did you figure out what the issue with the error was?
#I actually looked at the code for a few minutes and didn't recognize that the end to the loop wasn't there, but after I walked away to get water and looked at it again I noticed it was missing.

#Were you able to determine why each error message happened based on the code?
#yes!

#When you encounter errors in future code, what process will you follow to help you debug?
#This is very helpful, I will also look to the additional information it gives about the error. That proved to be the most helpful for anything that may not be super obvious.
