## Intro to Database Schemas & SQL

1. Select all data for all states
```
SELECT * FROM states;
```
2. Select all data for all regions
```
SELECT * FROM regions;
```
3.Select the state_name and population for all states
```
SELECT state_name, population FROM states;
```
4. Select the state_name and population for all states ordered by population. The state with the highest population should be at the top.
```
SELECT state_name, population FROM states
ORDER BY population DESC;
```
5. Select the state_name for the states in region 7.
```
SELECT state_name FROM states
WHERE region_id = 7;
```
6. Select the state_name and population_density for states with a population density over 50 ordered from least to most dense.
```
SELECT state_name, population_density FROM states WHERE population_density > 50
ORDER BY population_density ASC;
```
7. Select the state_name for states with a population between 1 million and 1.5 million people.
```
SELECT state_name FROM states WHERE population BETWEEN 1000000 AND 1500000;
```
8. Select the state_name and region_id for states ordered by region in ascending order.
```
SELECT states.state_name, states.region_id FROM states
ORDER BY region_id ASC;
```
9. Select the region_name for the regions with "Central" in the name.
```
SELECT region_name FROM regions WHERE region_name LIKE '%Central%';
```
10. Select the region_name and the state_name for all states and regions in ascending order by region_id.
```
SELECT region_name, state_name FROM states, regions
ORDER BY region_id ASC;
```

## Reflection

<!-- What are databases for?
To hold large amounts of data

What is a one-to-many relationship?
When there are multiple of objects belonging to a single group.

What is a primary key? What is a foreign key?
A primary key will always have unique values, and will not return null. A foreign key is what connects one table to another, but may return null. There is only one primary key allowed per table, but any table may have multiple foreign keys.

How can you select information out of a SQL database? What are some general guidelines for that?
You use SQL commands in a statement to parse data. A simple guidelineâ€”commands are used in capital letters, and all statements must end with a semicolon. -->
